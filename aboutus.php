                    <p class="">Polina Shafran was born in Moscow, Russia, grew up in Israel and currently resides in
                        Louisville. Since early childhood her father used to take her to theatres. She got to see all the big
                        names of Russian theatre on Moscow stages. That’s when her love for theatre began. She got her theatre
                        education in Israel where she performed in multiple plays in both Russian and Hebrew. After arriving to
                        Louisville she joined local theatre community and has performed with such theatre companies as Savage
                        Rose Classical Theatre Company, Pandora Productions, The Bardstown Theatre, and many more.

                    </p>
                    <p class="bio-text-insert">
                        Her favorite theatre roles include Natalia in The Proposal, Witch in Macbeth, Joyce in The Ruffian
                        On The Stair and Olwen in Dangerous Corner.

                    </p>

                    <p class="bio-text">Being multilingual she sometimes tries her hand at the translation of plays, songs and
                        poetry. In 2013 she translated Chekov’s one act play The Proposal, which led to an interesting
                        discussion with Martin, the creation of The Chamber Theatre and a subsequent production of the play in
                        The Chamber Theatre's inaugural production Chek-Mate.

                    <p class="panel-body">The goal of the Chamber Theatre is to produce high quality small scale theatre that is
                        intimate,
                        personal, and engages directly with the audience. We want to explore some of the best modern
                        dramatists, particularly those from the late
                        19th and early 20th century. In doing so, we hope to reintroduce the texts to the public
                        through
                        a contemporary and local lens, reviving some, and taking others beyond the received
                        understanding of what they are. We want to reach
                        a wider audience through touring our productions. We aim to combine our blend of different
                        international theatrical backgrounds and experiences with the currents of the Louisville
                        Theatre
                        community to develop a distinct method
                        to our productions.
